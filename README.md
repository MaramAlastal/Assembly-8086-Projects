# Assembly 8086 Projects
This repository contains a collection of assembly codes explained in my YouTube video:

1. **Calculator:** Basic arithmetic operations and input handling.
2. **Factorial:** Calculating the factorial of a number.
3. **Find Max:** Finding the maximum value in a given array.
4. **String Search:** Searching for a specific character within a string.
5. **Sorting:** Implementing a sorting algorithm (Ascending order).

All programs were developed and tested using the **emu8086** emulator.
